<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
The doctype. It is required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
(around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the
HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
error checking and other useful things.

However these days, they don't do much, and are basically just needed to make
sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.

<!-- NOTE: "Elements" are code tags that denote the beginning and end of a piece
of content on a webpage. They start like "<elementname>" and end like "</elementname>"
 -->

<html>
<!-- This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes
known as the root element. It contains everything up to the </html> at the end. -->

  <head>
  <!-- This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on
  the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.
  This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to
  appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations
  and more. -->

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8
    which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.
    Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There
    is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on. -->

    <title>Exercise #1 - Kevin Carvalhais Juliani</title>
    <!-- This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the
    browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when
    you bookmark or favorite it. -->

  </head> <!-- This denotes the end of the "<head>" block! -->

  <body>
  <!-- This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit
  your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks or
  whatever else.-->
  
    <!-- NOTE: Please enter your name between the brackets below! -->

    Hello, world! My name is Kevin Carvalhais Juliani, and this is my first webpage!
    </p>
    <!-- This element is used to denote paragraphs of text. Everything between the "<p>"
    and "</p>" tags is inside one paragraph. As you can see below, we have another
    paragraph after this one, which will show up as a separate line automatically! -->
    
    <!-- NOTE: Please write anything you want here. It could be about yourself, a fun
    story, whatever you want! It's your webpage! -->

    <!-- This element contains a "hyperlink" to another webpage. You use this to link
    to other content of interest, such as other pages on your own website, pages on
    other websites, or sometimes as a trigger to perform certain actions. The style
    of the "<a>" usually is underlined to tell the user that it is clickable. -->
    
  </body> <!-- This denotes the end of the "<body>" block! -->
  
</html>
<!-- This denotes the end of the "<html>" block, which is the end of the entire webpage! -->
